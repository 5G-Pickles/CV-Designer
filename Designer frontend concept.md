# Designer frontend concept
This file contains overall design concept for the <b>Designer</b> part of the application. The app window consists of a listView of all the avalible components on the left hand side of the window (~33% of the window surface) and real-time preview/(21x30)grid where the components are placed (~66% of the window surface). Each gird square is static and is the smallest that each component can get.<br>
Each component will load with already prefilled info, provided by the user. If no information was provided, component loads with a default text eg. "Lorem ipsum"
When selected, each component can be styled using a top bar with predefined CSS styles.

## Fifth component - "Hard-skills"

## Sixth component - "Job experience"
